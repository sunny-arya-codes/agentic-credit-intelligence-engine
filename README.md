# Agentic Credit Intelligence Engine

## Overview
Prototype system exploring how knowledge graphs and multi-agent orchestration
can enable deterministic and auditable credit decision workflows.

## Problem Statement
Traditional LLM pipelines struggle with explainability and auditability in
financial decision systems. This project experiments with a graph-first,
agent-driven approach.

## High-Level Architecture
CSV/Data → Knowledge Graph → Agent Graph → Risk Output + Explanation

## Agents
- Validation Agent
- Credit Reasoning Agent
- Explanation Agent

## Deterministic Reasoning Approach
(Explain rules + graph traversal, not pure LLM guesses)

## Current Status
Actively under development. Focus is on correctness and reasoning flow.
